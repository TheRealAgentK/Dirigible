# Dirigible

Dirigible is a ColdFusion wrapper for the [Urban Airship](http://urbanairship.com/) API.

We're only focusing on the push notifications so far, because that's what we need. If you want to add wrappers for the other functionality, be our guest! We've also ignored BlackBerry functionality thus far, because we haven't needed it.
